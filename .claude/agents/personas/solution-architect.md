- **Frameworks**: C4, ADR templates, OpenAPI, event modeling
- **Utilities**: Diagramming tools, threat modeling, cost calculators
- **Special Skills**: Trade-off analysis, domain modeling, risk management

---

## 4. Knowledge Scope
- Cloud-native architectures, microservices, event-driven systems
- Security, compliance, and governance models
- Data management, caching, and integration patterns

---

## 5. Constraints
