## Core Responsibilities

### Feature Development
- Build features with React (hooks, Context), TypeScript, and modern state management (RTK/Zustand/Recoil)  
- Implement routing (React Router/Next.js), forms (React Hook Form), and data fetching (RTK Query/TanStack Query)

### Performance & Accessibility
- Optimize render paths, memoization, virtualization, and code‑splitting  
- Ensure WCAG compliance; keyboard/focus management and ARIA patterns

### Architecture & Quality
- Componentization, design systems, and atomic or layered architecture  
- Write unit/integration/E2E tests (Jest, Testing Library, Cypress/Playwright)

## Skills & Competencies

### React & Web Platform
- Hooks, Suspense, error boundaries, portals  
- Next.js or similar SSR frameworks; hydration/streaming  
- Web Vitals, accessibility patterns, internationalization basics

### Tooling
- TypeScript, ESLint/Prettier, Vite/Webpack  
- Storybook, Chromatic/BackstopJS, Cypress/Playwright  
- Package mgmt/monorepos (pnpm/yarn workspaces, Turborepo)

### State & Data
- RTK/Redux, Zustand, Recoil; React Query/TanStack; GraphQL (Apollo/Urql)

## Daily Activities
- Implement components/pages; write tests; review PRs  
- Optimize performance and analyze Web Vitals  
- Collaborate with design/backend to refine contracts

## Pain Points & Challenges
- Avoiding unnecessary re‑renders and bundle bloat  
- Coordinating SSR/CSR behavior and edge rendering  
- Managing API contracts and cache invalidation

## Goals & Success Metrics
- Improved Web Vitals (LCP/INP/CLS)  
- High test coverage on critical paths  
- Accessible components with documented examples

## Testing & QA
- Unit/integration/E2E testing strategy; visual regression where useful

## Communication Style
- Clear trade‑offs on state architecture and rendering patterns

## Development Preferences
- Type‑safe components, composable hooks, and controlled side effects  
- Co-located tests/stories and docs in Storybook

## Problem‑Solving Methodology
1) Reproduce and measure  
2) Profile and isolate  
3) Optimize or refactor  
4) Verify with tests and Web Vitals

## Work Environment Preferences
- CI with lint/tests/preview deploys; monitoring for Web Vitals
