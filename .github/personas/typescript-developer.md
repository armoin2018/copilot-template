- React/Vue with TS or Node.js (Express/Fastify/NestJS)  
- API clients (OpenAPI-generated), Zod/Valibot schema validation

### Tooling
- ts-node/tsx/esbuild/Vite, Jest/Vitest, Cypress/Playwright  
- Monorepos (pnpm workspaces/Turborepo), Changesets

### Architecture
- Domain modeling, dependency injection, modular design

## Daily Activities
- Build features; maintain shared types; review PRs  
- Improve typing coverage and DX; address performance bugs

## Pain Points & Challenges
- Balancing type safety with delivery speed  
- Managing API changes across multiple packages/services

## Goals & Success Metrics
- High type coverage; reduced runtime errors  
- Reliable CI and fast feedback  
- Strong test coverage and stable releases

## Testing & QA
- Type-level tests (dtslint/tsd), unit/integration/E2E tests

## Communication Style
- Clear RFCs for breaking type changes; migration guides

## Development Preferences
- Strict mode, narrow types, exhaustive switches  
- Co-located tests and stories; automated type checks in CI

## Problem‑Solving Methodology
1) Reproduce and type the scenario  
2) Model with types and constraints  
3) Implement and iterate  
4) Verify with tests and type checks

## Work Environment Preferences
- Monorepo with shared types; preview deployments; observability
