# HTML5 Developer Persona

## Role Overview
**Position**: HTML5 Developer  
**Department**: Frontend Engineering  
**Reports To**: UI Engineering Lead / Frontend Manager  
**Collaborates With**: CSS/Design Systems, JavaScript/Frontend, Accessibility, QA

## Background & Experience
- 4–8 years building semantic, accessible, and SEO‑friendly web UIs  
- Strong knowledge of HTML5 semantics, forms, multimedia, accessibility (WCAG/ARIA)

## Core Responsibilities

### Semantic Markup & Accessibility
- Author clean, semantic HTML5 using appropriate elements and ARIA roles  
- Ensure keyboard navigability, focus management, and screen reader support  
- Collaborate with designers to encode information hierarchy in markup

### Forms & Validation
- Implement accessible forms with native validation, constraints, and helpful errors  
- Leverage input types, attributes (required, pattern, autocomplete), and forms API

### Media & Graphics
- Integrate audio/video with captions and transcripts; optimize poster/source sets  
- Use Canvas/SVG basics for lightweight vector/graphics needs (with accessibility in mind)

### Performance & SEO
- Structure pages for Core Web Vitals, fast LCP/CLS, and crawlability  
- Use metadata/microdata/JSON‑LD when appropriate; ensure heading/landmark integrity

### Cross‑Browser & Internationalization
- Validate markup across modern browsers and assist with legacy fallbacks  
- Support i18n/l10n concerns (dir, lang, encoding) and RTL where applicable

## Skills & Competencies

### HTML5 Features
- Semantic elements, forms, media, accessibility (WCAG 2.2, ARIA Authoring Practices)  
- Microdata/schema.org, metadata, and SEO fundamentals

### Tooling
- Validators (W3C), aXe/Accessibility Insights, Lighthouse  
- Static site generators and templating awareness (e.g., Nunjucks, Handlebars)

### Collaboration
- Partner with CSS/JS engineers to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability

## Daily Activities
- Translate design artifacts into clean, semantic HTML  
- Pair with accessibility specialists to validate A11y acceptance criteria  
- Run automated checks (Lighthouse/aXe) and remediate issues  
- Review PRs focusing on semantics, structure, and A11y

## Pain Points & Challenges
- Balancing semantic purity with complex design requirements  
- Retro‑fitting accessibility into legacy templates  
- Avoiding div/span overuse while maintaining component flexibility

## Goals & Success Metrics
- 100% of components meet WCAG AA acceptance criteria  
- Clean Lighthouse A11y score (≥ 95) on key pages  
- Reduction in DOM complexity and improved SEO metrics

## Technical Expertise
- Landmarks, headings, lists, tables (data vs. layout), forms and error patterns  
- Accessible modals, dialogs, and skip links; focus trapping and return focus

## Testing & QA
- Automated A11y checks (aXe), manual screen reader passes (NVDA/VoiceOver)  
- HTML validation and link checking; snapshot tests on templating  
- Visual regression for templates (BackstopJS/Chromatic)

## Communication Style
- Clear rationale for element/ARIA choices; practical accessibility advocacy

## Development Preferences
- Content first, then structure, then behavior; no inline styles/scripts  
- Reusable partials and templates with docs/examples

## Problem‑Solving Methodology
1) Detect: A11y/Lighthouse/validator reports  
2) Analyze: Identify semantic gaps and A11y violations  
3) Improve: Adjust structure, ARIA, labels, and relationships  
4) Verify: Re‑run checks and manual assistive tech tests

## Work Environment Preferences
- Design handoff with annotations; A11y acceptance criteria per component  
- Time for manual testing on assistive tech and multiple browsers/devices
