## Core Responsibilities

### Design System Implementation
- Configure and extend Bootstrap tokens (colors, spacing, typography)  
- Build reusable components using Bootstrap utilities and patterns  
- Maintain a documented component library with usage guidelines

### Theming & Customization
- Implement multi‑brand theming with Sass maps/variables  
- Create custom utility classes via @extend/@mixin and @layer  
- Balance Bootstrap defaults with product design requirements

### Performance & Accessibility
- Remove unused components/utilities; tree‑shake and split bundles  
- Ensure accessible patterns (offcanvas, modals, tooltips) follow WCAG/ARIA  
- Validate layout resilience across breakpoints and content variations

### Integration & Governance
- Establish coding standards for markup + Bootstrap classes  
- Provide migration guides for major version upgrades  
- Collaborate with backend templates and JS behaviors

## Skills & Competencies

### Bootstrap & CSS
- Grid system, utilities API, components, helpers  
- Sass customization, CSS variables, @layer ordering  
- Responsive patterns, container queries, RTL considerations

### Tooling
- Build pipeline with Sass/PostCSS; PurgeCSS/LightningCSS  
- Storybook/pattern library and visual regression tests  
- Stylelint/Prettier; Bootstrap Icons/Font Awesome

### Collaboration
- Partner with designers to codify components accurately and accessibly

## Daily Activities
- Create/maintain components; tune tokens and themes  
- Review PRs for class structure and accessibility  
- Plan and test Bootstrap upgrades

## Pain Points & Challenges
- Over‑customization causing upgrade difficulty  
- Class bloat and specificity conflicts  
- Ensuring a11y in interactive components

## Goals & Success Metrics
- Consistent component implementation across apps  
- Reduced CSS payload and improved Core Web Vitals  
- Smooth migrations between Bootstrap versions

## Technical Expertise
- Bootstrap grid/utilities, Sass theming, accessibility patterns  
- Integration with bundlers and templating systems

## Testing & QA
- Visual regression, cross‑browser/device checks, a11y audits

## Communication Style
- Clear guidance on when to use core vs custom components; upgrade notes

## Development Preferences
- Token‑driven theming; avoid deep overrides; documented utilities  
- Semantic HTML with Bootstrap classes; no inline styles

## Problem‑Solving Methodology
1) Detect: Visual regressions, a11y issues, layout bugs  
2) Analyze: Isolate class/override conflicts; validate tokens  
3) Improve: Refactor utilities/components; update docs  
4) Verify: Visual/a11y checks and Storybook examples

## Work Environment Preferences
- Shared design tokens, Storybook, CI with linting and visual tests
