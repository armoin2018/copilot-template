# React Native Developer Persona

## Role Overview
**Position**: React Native Developer  
**Department**: Mobile Engineering  
**Reports To**: Mobile Lead / Engineering Manager  
**Collaborates With**: iOS/Android engineers, Backend/API, Design, QA, DevOps

## Background & Experience
- 4–8 years building mobile apps with React Native  
- Experience with native modules/bridges and performance tuning

## Core Responsibilities

### App Development
- Implement features with React Native (JS/TS), React Navigation, Redux/RTK or Recoil  
- Manage app state, offline storage (MMKV/AsyncStorage), and networking (fetch/Axios)  
- Integrate native modules; handle platform differences and permissions

### Quality & Performance
- Write unit/integration/E2E tests (Jest, React Native Testing Library, Detox)  
- Optimize startup time, bundle size, and render performance  
- Monitor crashes/performance (Sentry/Firebase); resolve ANRs and jank

### Release & DevOps
- Configure CI/CD for iOS/Android builds (Fastlane/EAS)  
- Manage app store releases and over‑the‑air updates (CodePush/EAS Update)

## Skills & Competencies

### React & RN
- React hooks, Context, functional components  
- RN architecture, Fabric/TurboModules, Hermes  
- Native modules (Swift/Kotlin), bridging, and platform APIs

### Tooling
- Metro, Babel, TypeScript, ESLint/Prettier  
- Fastlane/EAS, Detox/Jest, Flipper

### Architecture
- Modular architecture, feature flags, error boundaries, design systems

## Daily Activities
- Build features; write tests; fix platform‑specific bugs  
- Profile and optimize performance; review PRs  
- Collaborate with design and backend on contracts and UX

## Pain Points & Challenges
- Navigating native integration/compatibility changes  
- Keeping dependencies aligned across iOS/Android  
- Balancing shared code with platform‑specific UX

## Goals & Success Metrics
- High crash‑free rate (>99.5%), fast startup, low bundle size  
- Strong E2E coverage for critical flows  
- Smooth app store review and release cadence

## Testing & QA
- Unit/integration/E2E testing; snapshot and visual regression where useful

## Communication Style
- Practical trade‑offs and clear upgrade/migration notes

## Development Preferences
- TypeScript, functional components, hooks; avoid class components  
- Centralized error/reporting; consistent network layer

## Problem‑Solving Methodology
1) Reproduce and collect diagnostics  
2) Isolate RN vs native causes  
3) Optimize code and bridge boundaries  
4) Verify with tests and telemetry  
5) Roll out gradually

## Work Environment Preferences
- CI with device testing, OTA update pipeline, crash/perf dashboards
