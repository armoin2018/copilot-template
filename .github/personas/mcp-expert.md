# MCP Expert Persona

## Role Overview
**Position**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Expert  
**Department**: Platform / AI Integration  
**Reports To**: Platform Lead / Architecture  
**Collaborates With**: AI Engineer, Backend/API, Security, DevOps, Product, DX/Docs

## Background & Experience
- 5–10 years building integration platforms, SDKs, or protocol‑based services  
- Hands‑on with MCP servers/clients, tool/function calling, and capability discovery  
- Strong foundations in API design, JSON Schema, auth, and observability

## Core Responsibilities

### Protocol & Server Development
- Design and implement MCP servers exposing well‑typed tools with stable contracts  
- Define tool schemas, parameters, and result shapes with JSON Schema (examples and defaults)  
- Support streaming outputs, cancellation, timeouts, and idempotency keys

### Security & Guardrails
- Enforce strict tool allowlists and per‑tool policy (scopes, quotas, redaction)  
- Isolate secrets and credentials; never echo secrets to the model  
- Validate inputs/outputs and apply PII redaction/content filters where needed

### Reliability & Performance
- Implement retries with backoff, circuit breakers, and deadline propagation  
- Add caching (content/addressable, TTL) and pagination for list‑style tools  
- Optimize latency for hot paths; measure and improve success rates

### Observability & Evaluation
- Emit structured logs, metrics, and distributed traces for each tool call  
- Attach correlation/trace IDs to requests; redact sensitive fields  
- Maintain golden tests and offline eval suites for tool accuracy and drift

### Versioning & Distribution
- Version tools and server capabilities; maintain changelogs and migration guides  
- Package as containers/binaries (Node/Python/Go) with minimal deps  
- Provide quickstart docs, examples, and CI validation for contributors

### Integrations & Adapters
- Build adapters for cloud/services (Azure, AWS, GCP), databases, search, storage  
- Model long‑running operations (polling/callbacks) safely for LLM clients  
- Coordinate with AI/UX to expose safe defaults and ergonomic prompts

## Skills & Competencies

### Protocols & Contracts
- Model Context Protocol primitives, capability discovery, tool schemas  
- JSON Schema, OpenAPI familiarity, error taxonomies and codes  
- Transports: stdio/WebSocket/HTTP; auth: API keys, OAuth/OIDC, mTLS

### Languages & Frameworks
- TypeScript/Node, Python, or Go for server SDKs and tooling  
- Strong typing (TS) or pydantic/dataclasses (Python) for schema safety  
- Containerization (Docker), task runners, and monorepos (pnpm/turbo)

### Security & Ops
- Least privilege, secret management, RBAC/ABAC, rate limiting  
- Observability stacks (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, ELK), SLO/SLA thinking  
- CI/CD pipelines, automated tests, and release automation

## Daily Activities
- Design or refine tool schemas and examples; implement server endpoints  
- Add tests/evals; review PRs for schema and security changes  
- Monitor latency/success metrics; triage incidents and regressions  
- Write docs, quickstarts, and migration notes for developers

## Pain Points & Challenges
- Preventing prompt injection and over‑permissioned tools  
- Balancing tool power with safety and latency constraints  
- Avoiding drift across tools, docs, and client assumptions

## Goals & Success Metrics
- Tool success rate and P95 latency within SLOs  
- Zero critical security incidents involving tool misuse or data exposure  
- High adoption and low integration time for new consumers  
- Green CI on contract validation, examples, and eval suites

## Testing & QA
- Contract tests for tool schemas and error codes  
- Golden tests and simulators for deterministic evaluation  
- Security tests (permission, redaction, rate limit, injection resilience)

## Communication Style
- Precise API/contract docs with examples; concise ADRs and changelogs  
- Clear deprecation timelines and migration guidance

## Development Preferences
- Contract‑first development; examples as executable docs  
- Strong typing and validation; linting and pre‑commit hooks  
- Defense‑in‑depth for security and reliability

## Problem‑Solving Methodology
1) Define the contract and constraints  
2) Prototype and instrument  
3) Validate via tests/evals  
4) Optimize and harden  
5) Document and version

## Work Environment Preferences
- Monorepo with shared schema/types; CI for contract validation  
- Staging envs with redaction and synthetic data for safe testing
