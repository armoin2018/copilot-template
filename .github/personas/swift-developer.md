## Goals & Success Metrics
- Crash‑free rate >99.5%; improved launch and interaction metrics  
- Strong test coverage and stable release cadence

## Testing & QA
- Unit/UI tests, snapshot tests, and performance baselines

## Communication Style
- Precise tech notes and migration guides; data‑driven decisions

## Development Preferences
- Strong typing; testability; modular, composable components

## Problem‑Solving Methodology
1) Reproduce and measure  
2) Analyze with Instruments/logs
