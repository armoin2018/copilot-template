# Universal Project Coding & Management Guide

This guide defines universal coding standards and project management workflows to account for clarity, traceability, compliance, and coordination practices for multi-language development projects.  The following guidelines outline how requirements, plans, instructions, personas, documentation, testing and library usage are managed.

## Requirements

- All project requirements must be defined in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Each task references relevant requirements from this file

## Execution Plans

- Detailed execution plans are created in `PLAN.md` based on the requirements in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Use Agile methodology by creating Epics, Stories and Tasks
- Each Epic, Stor yor Task should include user stories, priority, and acceptance criteria. 
- The `PLAN.md` should provide a detailed outline of tasks, milestones, deliverables and acceptance criteria.
- The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` should be used to guide the creation and execution of these plans.
- Each Agile Epic, Story or Task references necessary instruction files stored under the `.github/instructions/` directory.
- Each Agile Epic, Story or Task may also reference relevant personas from the `.github/personas/` directory.
- If additional context or clarification is needed, team members should consult the relevant instruction files or personas.
- If personas are not sufficient, generate new ones as needed.
- If instructions are not sufficient, create new ones as needed.

## Change Tracking

- Keep track of the progress using `HISTORY.md` referencing the version to allow resuming, replay and rollback.
- Create Difference (diff/patch) files under `diff/` to allow for patching and rollback to specific versions.
- A summary of changes should be tracked and documented in `CHANGELOG.md` with most recent at the top.
- Version Format `YYYY.MM.DD-<#####>` (e.g. `2023.03.15-00001`)
- Each entry must include: version, date, description of changes, instructions used, personas used.

## Documentation

- Project documentation is maintained as a GitHub Wiki under `wiki/`
- Project client documentation is maintained as GitHub Pages under `docs/`
- Functions should be documented with meaningful comments
- Architecture diagrams and design documents should be stored in `wiki/architecture/` using PlantUML
- Swagger JSON file for REST APIs should be stored in `wiki/api/`

## Library Management 

- Approved libraries and modules are listed in `WHITELIST.md`
- Prohibited/deprecated modules and practices are listed in `BLACKLIST.md`
- If a new library is needed, it must be added to `WHITELIST.md` with justification.

## Compliance and Standards

### Legal Considerations

- Ensure all code complies with licensing requirements.
- Focus on utilizing approved libraries and frameworks.
- Prioritize MIT-licensed libraries and frameworks.
- Avoid using Copyrighted, proprietary or unlicensed code.
- Follow fair use guidelines for any third-party content.

### Industry Standards

- Follow industry best practices for security, performance, and reliability.
- Stay up-to-date with relevant regulations and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Adhere to established coding standards and guidelines (e.g., OWASP Top Ten).
- Participate in industry forums and communities to share knowledge and learn from peers.
- Implement accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) in all projects.
- Use semantic versioning for all releases.

---

## UI/UX Standards

### Design Principles
- Prioritize user-centered design and usability.
- Ensure consistency in design elements (e.g., colors, typography).
- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Conduct user research and testing to validate design decisions.
- Allow Dark Mode and other accessibility features.
- Allow for customization and personalization options through Theme settings.

### Layered Architecture (UI/Style/Model/Logic/Data)
- Strict separation of concerns across layers:
  - UI (HTML/templates) = structure only; no inline JS or business logic.
  - Style (CSS/SCSS) = presentation only; no behavior.
  - Client Logic (JavaScript) = interacts with APIs, handles state/UI events; no embedded HTML generation beyond templating and DOM updates.
  - Server Logic (e.g., Node/PHP) = API endpoints and domain logic; no HTML rendering in API services.
  - Data Layer (DB/cache/queues) = persistence and messaging; accessed only via service layer.
- File placement conventions:
  - Place JS under `assets/js/`, CSS under `assets/css/`, images under `assets/images/`.
  - Keep templates/views separate from server logic code.
- UI communicates with the system exclusively via APIs (no direct DB/file access from UI).
- Favor composition and small modules; avoid deeply nested directories.

---

## API & Microservices Standards

### Design Principles
- Follow REST API design principles (e.g., resource naming, versioning).
- Implement rate limiting and throttling for APIs.
- Use pagination for large datasets.
- Provide clear and concise API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Include error handling and validation in API design.

### API documentation & Swagger/OpenAPI
- Maintain an authoritative OpenAPI (Swagger) spec at repo root (e.g., `wiki/api/openapi.yaml` or `openapi.yaml`).
- Expose machine-readable schema at `/openapi.json` or `/openapi.yaml` and interactive docs at `/docs` (Swagger UI or Redoc).
- Validate the OpenAPI spec in CI; fail builds on schema errors.
- Generate server/client stubs using OpenAPI Generator where practical to reduce drift.
- Document standard error schema, pagination, sorting, and filtering patterns.

#### HTTP response codes & error schema
- Every endpoint MUST document and return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptions:
  - 200 OK for successful retrieval
  - 201 Created for successful creation (include Location header when applicable)
  - 202 Accepted for async operations
  - 204 No Content for successful operations with no body
  - 400 Bad Request for validation errors
  - 401 Unauthorized when authentication is required/invalid
  - 403 Forbidden when authenticated but not authorized
  - 404 Not Found for missing resources
  - 409 Conflict for versioning/state conflicts
  - 422 Unprocessable Entity for semantic validation failures
  - 429 Too Many Requests for rate limits
  - 5xx for server-side errors (prefer 500, 502, 503, 504 as appropriate)
- Define a standard error object (documented in OpenAPI):
  - `code` (string, machine-readable error code)
  - `message` (human-readable summary)
  - `details` (optional structured info e.g., field validation errors)
  - `traceId` (correlation ID for support)
- Ensure examples in OpenAPI include both success and error responses.

### Auth & API keys
- Support API keys as a first-class auth mechanism where appropriate (alongside OAuth2/JWT).
- Keys are environment-managed secrets; never hardcode. Store in secret managers or env vars only.
- Define key scope (read/write), rate limits/quotas, and expiration/rotation policies.
- Accept API keys via `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key` header (documented in OpenAPI).
- Log auth events (issued, rotated, revoked) with correlation IDs; never log full keys.

### Realtime & async interfaces
- For push-style updates, provide Webhooks, WebSockets, or Server-Sent Events (SSE) with auth.
- Publish event schemas for notifications; reuse domain event types from EDA where possible.
- Document retry, idempotency, and signature verification for webhooks.

### Service design and boundaries
- Prefer small, loosely coupled services with clear ownership and SLAs.
- Define service contracts first (API-first via OpenAPI); generate clients/servers where practical.
- Keep data ownership within a single service; expose via APIs rather than shared DB access.

### Versioning and compatibility
- Prefer backward-compatible changes; when breaking, introduce a new version (e.g., /v2).
- Deprecate with notices and timelines; provide migration guides in `wiki/`.

### Resilience and scalability
- Enforce timeouts, retries with backoff, and circuit breakers at clients and gateways.
- Support idempotency (Idempotency-Key header) for POST/PUT to enable safe retries.
- Use API Gateway for routing, auth, quotas, and monitoring; consider a service mesh for east-west traffic.

### Observability
- Emit structured logs (JSON), metrics, and traces (OpenTelemetry). Propagate correlation/trace IDs end-to-end.
- Expose health/readiness endpoints and SLOs; include error budgets in service docs.

### Security
- Adopt Zero Trust: mTLS between services, JWT/OAuth2 for authN/Z, least privilege for data access.
- Validate inputs at the edge; sanitize outputs; never expose stack traces to clients.

### Contract and consumer-driven testing
- Maintain contract tests (e.g., Pact) to ensure providers and consumers remain compatible.
- Automate contract verification in CI before deployment.

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- Use events to decouple services for asynchronous workflows; prefer at-least-once delivery with idempotent handlers.
- Standardize event schemas (e.g., CloudEvents) and version them; publish schema docs in `wiki/api/`.
- Implement the transactional outbox pattern for reliable event publishing with databases.
- Provide dead-letter queues (DLQs) and retry policies; include visibility into failure reasons.
- Avoid synchronous chains across many services; compose via events or sagas for long-running transactions.
 - Prefer event-first design for workflows tolerant to eventual consistency; default to API sync only when strict request/response is required.


## AI & Intelligent Systems Standards

### AI-first architecture
- Design a thin AI abstraction layer so product code depends on interfaces, not vendors.
- Support multiple AI interfaces: chat/completions, embeddings, image, audio, tool/function-calling, RAG.
- Prefer event-driven workflows for long-running inference (enqueue → worker → callback/notification).
 - All UI access to AI goes through API services; the UI never calls AI providers directly.

### Configurable AI providers
- Configure provider and model via environment variables and `ai.config.(json|yaml)` at repo root.
- Required keys (superset across providers):
  - `provider` (e.g., azureopenai|openai|anthropic|google|ollama|hf)
  - `endpoint`, `region` (if applicable), `model`, `apiKey` (via env), `organization` (optional)
  - runtime: `temperature`, `topP`, `maxTokens`, `seed`, `timeoutMs`, `retries`, `stream`
  - features: `enableTools`, `toolsAllowlist`, `safety` (categories, thresholds), `telemetry` (sampling)
- Hot-swap providers/models without code changes; use adapter pattern per provider.
 - Provide a single API surface (REST and/or WebSocket) with stable contracts independent of provider.

### Guardrails & safety
- Implement input/output validation and PII redaction; never log raw secrets or full prompts.
- Apply content filters at the edge; block prompt injection via strict tool allowlists and schema validation.
- Version prompt templates; store in repo with change history and owners.

### Observability & evaluation
- Trace requests with OpenTelemetry; include model, tokens, latency, cache status (no PII).
- Maintain golden prompts and offline eval suites; require eval gates before model/prompt changes ship.
- Record prompt/template version in responses for reproducibility.

### Reliability & cost controls
- Provide fallback chains (primary → secondary model/provider) with circuit breakers.
- Implement caching (embeddings, RAG chunks, response caching where safe) with TTLs and invalidation.
- Enforce quotas and budgets; alert on anomaly spend or latency.
 - Support per-tenant API keys for AI endpoints with scoped quotas and usage reporting.

### Data & RAG
- Separate retrieval layer from generation; use typed schemas and deterministic chunking.
- Track document/source lineage in responses; surface citations when applicable.
- Respect data residency and retention policies; purge on request.
